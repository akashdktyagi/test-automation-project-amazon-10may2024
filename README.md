# Test Automation Framework using Cucumber, Selenium, Java
### Feat: Selenium Grid, Docker, Gitlab, CI CD Pipeline

#### Note: 
This project is divided in to two modules. Module 1 named as: ```code-which-just-works``` will always have working code.
This is the place I always make sure the correct working code is available. 
Module 2 named as: ```during-session``` will have the code which is not working or need refactoring. which I create during the sessions.
So always refer to the ```code-which-just-works``` module for the correct working code.
